Here's a Python program to display the current time and date in a colorful and large format using the datetime module and rich library for styling. The rich library makes terminal output look great with colors and formatted text.
Purpose of the Program
This program is designed to display the current date and time in an aesthetically pleasing and visually appealing format by incorporating rich styling elements such as color, bold text, and alignment. The rich library is used to enhance terminal output, making the display lively and engaging.

Key Components
datetime Module:

The datetime module is a standard Python library used to manipulate dates and times.

The function datetime.now() retrieves the current date and time from the system.

The strftime() method formats the date and time into human-readable strings, such as "Saturday, 12 April 2025" for the date and "06:14:28 PM" for the time.

rich Library:

The rich library enables the use of advanced text formatting and styling directly in the terminal output.

Console() from rich.console is used to create a styled console environment.

Text() from rich.text allows formatting of strings with specific styles, such as colors, bold, and background.

Custom Styling:

The program uses Text() objects with styling such as:

bold blue on yellow for the date.

bold magenta on green for the time.

Styling not only makes the output visually appealing but also helps highlight important information.

Interactive Features:

The output is aligned to the center for an organized and professional appearance.

A header line with contrasting styling (e.g., white on dark_blue) introduces the date and time display.

Step-by-Step Flow of the Program
Import Libraries:

The program imports the datetime module to fetch the current date and time.

It also imports the rich.console and rich.text classes to enable terminal styling.

Date and Time Extraction:

The datetime.now() function fetches the system's current date and time.

The strftime() method formats these values into customized strings.

Text Styling:

The formatted date and time strings are wrapped into Text() objects with applied styles (color and background).

The styled text is then printed to the console using the console.print() method.

Console Display:

The console header introduces the output.

Styled date and time strings are printed below the header, aligned to the center for visual emphasis.

Why Use the rich Library?
The rich library simplifies advanced text styling in Python:

It supports color, formatting, and alignment without requiring complex terminal escape codes.

It creates vibrant, polished, and user-friendly terminal outputs, which are useful for applications where aesthetics matter.

Running the Code
To execute this program:

Install Rich Library:

bash
pip install rich
Save the Code: Store it in a .py file (e.g., colorful_date_time.py).

Run the Program: Open the terminal and run:
